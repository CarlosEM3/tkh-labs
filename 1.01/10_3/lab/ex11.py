# Exercise 1.1. It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so
# you can try out the examples as you go.

# Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make
# mistakes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens if you
# leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if
# you spell print wrong?

# This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when
# you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean.
# It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.

# 1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the
# parentheses, or both?

#print Hello World
#In the terminal it returns an error.

# 2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one
# of the quotation marks, or both?

#print(Hello World)
#In the terminal it returns an error

# 3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2.
# What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

#print(-2)
#print(+2)
#print(2++2)
#In the

# 4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 09. What happens if you try
# this in Python?  What about 011?

#print(09)

#We get a syntax error that states that leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted. 
#This is because for interger numeric data types we need a whole counting number 

# 5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them? "22", "11"

#print(2211)

#Having two values with no operator between them, it just returns the two values togther. In this example 2211.
